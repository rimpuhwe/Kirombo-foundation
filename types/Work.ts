      Education remains one of the most powerful tools for breaking the cycle of poverty, and 
      at the Abdallah Kiromba Foundation, this belief guides 
      everything we do. Across 14 districts in Rwanda, many vulnerable children still face 
      barriers that prevent them from accessing quality learning opportunities. 
      Our foundation is committed to changing this reality by ensuring that every child especially 
      foundlings, orphans, and those from low-income households receives the support they need to 
      stay in school and dream beyond their circumstances.

      <p>
      For ensuring better Education, we provide school fees, learning materials, uniforms, and 
      ongoing mentorship to children who would otherwise be left behind. Beyond financial assistance, we 
      foster an environment where each child feels valued, supported, and encouraged to aim higher. 
      Our team works closely with schools, local leaders, and community members to make sure that children 
      enrolled in schools can learn in safe, stable, and nurturing conditions.

      <p>
      Today, over 100 orphans are actively benefiting from our support, and this number continues 
      to grow every year. Each story represents a life transformed and a future reclaimed. As we 
      expand our efforts, our vision remains clear: to build a generation of resilient, educated, 
      and empowered young people who will one day uplift their communities and carry forward the 
      legacy of compassion that defines the Abdallah Kiromba Foundation.

      <p>
      Hope is the foundation of every child’s growth, yet for many orphaned and abandoned children, 
      that hope fades far too early. Losing parents means losing not just love and protection, 
      but also the sense of security every child needs to dream and thrive. At the Abdallah Kiromba 
      Foundation, we recognize this deep vulnerability and step in to restore hope where it has been 
      lost. Our Orphan Care Program exists to ensure that no child grows up believing they are alone 
      in the world.

      Through this program, we provide comprehensive support that goes beyond basic needs. We offer safe 
      shelter, access to education, food assistance, medical care, and emotional support through dedicated 
      caregivers and mentors.

        Most importantly, we give these children the gift of a future. The Orphan Care Program helps them grow with 
        confidence, stability, and new possibilities. With every child we support, we are not only restoring hope but also 
        shaping a generation that will rise stronger than the circumstances they were born into. The Abdallah Kiromba Foundation 
        stands as a reminder that every life, no matter how humble its beginning, deserves dignity, opportunity, and love.

    fullContent: `
    <p>
    In Islam, giving is more than a charitable act. it is a form of worship, a purification of the heart, and a pathway to 
    earn the pleasure of Allah. Sadaqah, in its essence, means offering something purely for the sake of Allah without 
    expecting anything in return. Scholars like Ar-Raghib al-Asfahaani describe sadaqah as a gift given from one’s own wealth 
    or effort with the sincere intention of drawing closer to Allah. 
    It is an act rooted in compassion, generosity, and the desire to uplift others.
    </p>

    <p>
    This Hadith highlights how simple acts such as offering a meal can multiply in blessings and 
    benefit both the giver and the receiver. Through these teachings, we learn that charity is 
    not measured by its size, but by the sincerity behind it.

    <p>
    At the Abdallah Kiromba Foundation, our Islamic Giving sessions are built upon these principles. 
    We encourage Muslims to engage in sadaqah, whether in the form of food distribution, supporting 
    vulnerable families, helping orphans, or contributing to community projects that bring long-term benefit. 
    Each act of giving becomes a bridge of mercy ,uplifting those in need while bringing ongoing blessings to the giver. 
    Through this spiritual and community-centered initiative, we strive to revive the true spirit of sadaqah and strengthen 
    bonds of compassion within our society.

    <p>
Last Friday marked a significant and highly beneficial collaborative event as the SheCanCODE
cohort and the dedicated staff of the Igire Rwanda Organization (IRO) came together for an
inspiring and intensely practical first-aid session. This vital training was expertly conducted by
the Ambucycle team, whose specialized knowledge and hands-on approach provided an
invaluable learning experience for all participants.
    </p>
<br/>
    <p>
The session was meticulously designed to equip attendees with critical life-saving skills, moving
beyond theoretical knowledge to practical application. It served as a powerful and timely
reminder that in emergencies, a combination of fundamental skills, specifically, maintaining
composure under pressure, executing correct and precise techniques, and possessing the
confidence to act decisively, is the absolute deciding factor. These elements collectively bridge
the gap between initial panic and the ability to initiate an effective and potentially life-saving
rescue. The training underscored the profound impact that preparedness can have, empowering
individuals to respond with efficiency and empathy when faced with medical emergencies.

    <img src="/images/IG Flyer template - Shecancode (2).jpg" alt="SheCanCODE and IRO collaboration" style="width:100%; border-radius:12px; margin:1.5rem 0;"/>
    <p>
SheCanCODE is dedicated to empowering individuals not just with cutting-edge digital skills for robust career advancement,
but also with a comprehensive suite of life skills that are crucial for navigating unforeseen challenges.
 We strongly recognize that while technical proficiency opens doors,
  the ability to respond effectively in emergencies is paramount for the safety and resilience of our community.
    </p>

    <p>
      This commitment led us to partner with Ambucycle, a renowned organization specializing in emergency medical training. By equipping all our learners and staff with practical, hands-on medical knowledge, we are significantly enhancing the safety and preparedness of every individual within the SheCanCODE ecosystem. Ambucycle's highly effective approach made essential medical information incredibly easy to understand and immediately applicable in real-world scenarios. Their training covered a wide range of critical topics, from basic first aid and CPR to managing common injuries and understanding when to seek professional medical help. This initiative ensures that our entire community is better prepared to handle unexpected medical situations, fostering a safer and more secure environment for everyone.

    <h2 style="font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:900; margin-top:2rem; text-transform:uppercase;">What We Learned</h2>
    <img src="/images/IG Flyer template - Shecancode (1)(1).jpg" alt="Participants practicing first aid" style="width:100%; border-radius:12px; margin:1.5rem 0;"/>
    <p>
Ambucycle conducted an in-depth and highly interactive training session that seamlessly integrated theoretical explanations with practical demonstrations and hands-on exercises. The curriculum was meticulously designed to cover a broad spectrum of critical first-aid skills, ensuring participants gained both knowledge and practical proficiency.
    </p>
    <br />
<p>The core areas of focus within the session included:
</p>
    <br />
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 20px;">
      <li><strong>Scene Assessment and Safety Procedures:</strong> Participants were thoroughly trained on how to approach an emergency situation safely. This involved learning to quickly and accurately assess the scene for potential dangers to themselves, the injured individual, and bystanders, and how to mitigate these risks before assisting. Emphasis was placed on prioritizing personal safety to avoid becoming a second casualty.</li>
      <br/>
      <li><strong>Effective Communication with Emergency Responders and Proper Methods for Calling for Help:</strong>A significant portion of the training was dedicated to mastering clear and concise communication with emergency services. This included understanding what vital information to relay (e.g., location, nature of injury, number of casualties), how to remain calm under pressure, and the correct procedures for initiating an emergency call to ensure a rapid and appropriate response.</li>
      <br/>
      <li><strong>Fundamental Wound Care and Bandaging Skills:</strong>Attendees received comprehensive instruction on various types of wounds and their appropriate initial management. This segment covered cleaning minor wounds, identifying signs of infection, and the correct techniques for applying different types of bandages to protect wounds and prevent further contamination.
</li>
<br/>
      <li><strong>Techniques for Managing Bleeding and Correctly Applying Pressure:</strong>Recognizing that uncontrolled bleeding can be life-threatening, the session provided detailed guidance on various methods to control hemorrhage. This included direct pressure, elevation, and the proper application of tourniquets in severe cases, ensuring participants understood when and how to use each technique effectively.
</li>
<br/>
      <li><strong>The Recovery Position and How to Assess Breathing: </strong>Participants learned the importance and correct application of the recovery position for unconscious individuals who are breathing. This included understanding how to safely move a casualty into this position to maintain an open airway and prevent aspiration, alongside practical methods for accurately assessing a person's breathing.
</li>
<br/>
      <li><strong>Basic CPR Procedures and Guidelines for Initiating Chest Compressions:</strong>A crucial component of the training involved hands-on practice of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). This segment covered the step-by-step process of performing chest compressions and rescue breaths, adhering to current guidelines for adult, child, and infant CPR, and understanding when to initiate and discontinue compressions. The focus was on ensuring participants could confidently perform this life-saving technique.
</li>
    </ul>
<br/>
    <p>
      Participants practiced scenarios, applied dressings, and role-played real emergencies  helping 
      them build muscle memory and confidence.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 style="font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:900; margin-top:2rem; text-transform:uppercase;">Moments That Stood Out</h2>
  
    <p>
      The emphasis was always on hands-on practice: participants got to role-play scenarios, apply dressings, and practice positioning - which is the fastest way to build muscle memory and confidence.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <img src="/images/IG Flyer template - Shecancode (3).jpg" alt="Ambucycle trainers guiding participants" style="width:80%; border-radius:12px; margin:1.5rem 0;"/>
<p>A cornerstone of the day's curriculum was the unwavering emphasis on the critical role of maintaining composure in high-stress situations. Throughout every module and practical exercise, instructors consistently underscored that a calm demeanor is not merely a desirable trait, but an essential prerequisite for clear, rational thinking and the ability to execute swift, effective actions. This sentiment resonated deeply with participants, as evidenced by one individual's poignant reflection: “Knowing what to do makes me feel stronger - I can help rather than freeze.” This powerful statement encapsulates the transformative impact of the training, shifting participants from potential paralysis to empowered intervention. The value of these practical demonstrations, tailored for diverse school and community environments, was repeatedly highlighted by IRO staff, who recognized their direct applicability in real-world scenarios.</p>
<br />
<p>Further solidifying these vital lessons, Ambucycle’s highly experienced trainers provided a series of concise, yet impactful, real-world anecdotes. These compelling narratives served as powerful illustrations of how rapid, straightforward responses, often involving seemingly simple actions, have been demonstrably instrumental in saving lives. By sharing these vivid accounts, the trainers effectively bridged the gap between abstract theoretical steps and their profound, life-altering impact, making the training immediately tangible and deeply resonant for all attendees. The stories transformed mere instructions into compelling evidence of the power of preparedness and quick thinking, reinforcing the central message that a calm, informed response can indeed be the difference between life and death.</p>
  </section>

  <section>

    <h2 style="font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:900; margin-top:2rem; text-transform:uppercase;">Thank You, Ambucycle</h2>
    
    <p>
      We would like to express our deepest gratitude and appreciation to the entire Ambucycle team for their exceptional dedication and expertise. Their contribution has been instrumental in equipping our participants and staff with critical, life-saving skills.
    </p>
<br />
    <p>
      The Ambucycle trainers consistently demonstrated a high level of professionalism, creating a positive and conducive learning environment. Their empathetic approach ensured that every individual felt supported and encouraged throughout the training sessions. They meticulously structured the curriculum, blending theoretical knowledge with practical, hands-on exercises, which significantly enhanced the learning experience. This practical methodology was key to empowering our team with invaluable skills that are not only applicable in emergencies but also in various aspects of their educational pursuits, personal lives, and active engagement within the wider community.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Specifically, the training focused on essential first aid techniques, emergency response protocols, and critical decision-making under pressure. Participants learned how to assess situations, provide immediate care, and effectively communicate with emergency services. These skills are particularly crucial for our staff who often work in educational settings, enabling them to respond swiftly and confidently to any unforeseen medical emergencies involving students or colleagues. Furthermore, the knowledge gained extends beyond professional boundaries, empowering individuals to act as responsible and prepared citizens within their communities, ready to assist family members, friends, or strangers in times of need.
