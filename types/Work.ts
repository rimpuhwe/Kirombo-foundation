      Education remains one of the most powerful tools for breaking the cycle of poverty, and 
      at the Abdallah Kiromba Foundation, this belief guides 
      everything we do. Across 14 districts in Rwanda, many vulnerable children still face 
      barriers that prevent them from accessing quality learning opportunities. 
      Our foundation is committed to changing this reality by ensuring that every child especially 
      foundlings, orphans, and those from low-income households receives the support they need to 
      stay in school and dream beyond their circumstances.

      <p>
      For ensuring better Education, we provide school fees, learning materials, uniforms, and 
      ongoing mentorship to children who would otherwise be left behind. Beyond financial assistance, we 
      foster an environment where each child feels valued, supported, and encouraged to aim higher. 
      Our team works closely with schools, local leaders, and community members to make sure that children 
      enrolled in schools can learn in safe, stable, and nurturing conditions.

      <p>
      Today, over 100 orphans are actively benefiting from our support, and this number continues 
      to grow every year. Each story represents a life transformed and a future reclaimed. As we 
      expand our efforts, our vision remains clear: to build a generation of resilient, educated, 
      and empowered young people who will one day uplift their communities and carry forward the 
      legacy of compassion that defines the Abdallah Kiromba Foundation.

      <p>
      Hope is the foundation of every child’s growth, yet for many orphaned and abandoned children, 
      that hope fades far too early. Losing parents means losing not just love and protection, 
      but also the sense of security every child needs to dream and thrive. At the Abdallah Kiromba 
      Foundation, we recognize this deep vulnerability and step in to restore hope where it has been 
      lost. Our Orphan Care Program exists to ensure that no child grows up believing they are alone 
      in the world.

      Through this program, we provide comprehensive support that goes beyond basic needs. We offer safe 
      shelter, access to education, food assistance, medical care, and emotional support through dedicated 
      caregivers and mentors.

        Most importantly, we give these children the gift of a future. The Orphan Care Program helps them grow with 
        confidence, stability, and new possibilities. With every child we support, we are not only restoring hope but also 
        shaping a generation that will rise stronger than the circumstances they were born into. The Abdallah Kiromba Foundation 
        stands as a reminder that every life, no matter how humble its beginning, deserves dignity, opportunity, and love.

    <p>
    In Islam, giving is more than a charitable act. it is a form of worship, a purification of the heart, and a pathway to 
    earn the pleasure of Allah. Sadaqah, in its essence, means offering something purely for the sake of Allah without 
    expecting anything in return. Scholars like Ar-Raghib al-Asfahaani describe sadaqah as a gift given from one’s own wealth 
    or effort with the sincere intention of drawing closer to Allah. 
    It is an act rooted in compassion, generosity, and the desire to uplift others.

    <blockquote style="margin: 1.5rem 0; font-style: italic; font-weight: 500;">
    “Whoever gives the food of fast breaking to the faster shall have the like of the faster in reward, 
    not diminishing the reward of the faster in the slightest.”<br/>

    </blockquote>

    <p>
    This Hadith highlights how simple acts such as offering a meal can multiply in blessings and 
    benefit both the giver and the receiver. Through these teachings, we learn that charity is 
    not measured by its size, but by the sincerity behind it.

    <p>
    At the Abdallah Kiromba Foundation, our Islamic Giving sessions are built upon these principles. 
    We encourage Muslims to engage in sadaqah, whether in the form of food distribution, supporting 
    vulnerable families, helping orphans, or contributing to community projects that bring long-term benefit. 
    Each act of giving becomes a bridge of mercy ,uplifting those in need while bringing ongoing blessings to the giver. 
    Through this spiritual and community-centered initiative, we strive to revive the true spirit of sadaqah and strengthen 
    bonds of compassion within our society.

     <h2 style="font-size:1rem; font-weight:900; margin:1.5rem 0; text-transform:uppercase;">The Water Crisis Affects Millions</h2>
     <p>
     These findings are from the U.N. World Water Development Report 2023. The report revealed that 2 billion people (26% of the population) lack 
     safe drinking water, while 3.6 billion (46%) lack access to safely managed sanitation.<br><br>
     In Rwanda, only 57 per cent of the population access safe drinking water that is within 30 minutes of their home. 
     When children spend time collecting water, it often keeps them out of school. This is an issue especially for girls, 
     who are often expected to take on the majority of household tasks.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Across many communities, limited access to clean water reinforces cycles of poverty, disease, and 
      inequality. Families often rely on unsafe water sources, leading to preventable illnesses that 
      strain already vulnerable households. The daily effort required to find and carry water reduces 
      the time available for education, work, and other essential activities that support long-term development.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
    By improving access to safe and reliable water sources, we help restore dignity and create 
    opportunities for healthier, more resilient communities. Ensuring clean water availability not 
    only protects public health; it also empowers children to stay in school, supports women’s and 
    girls’ rights, and builds a foundation for social and economic progress.

      Participants acquire essential tailoring skills including body measurement, fabric cutting, 
      garment sewing, and operation of manual and electric sewing machines. Many beneficiaries now 
      produce baby clothes, school uniforms, skirts, shirts, and simple dresses, significantly 
      reducing household expenses while creating opportunities for income generation.

      Beyond technical skills, the program restores hope and social confidence. Several participants

      — including access to advanced tools, childcare support, and trainer capacity — the demand and 
      impact of the program are evident.
